**RE: Application for Food & Beverage / Lounge Operations -- Morocco
Recruitment Event**

Dear Hiring Manager,

It is with great passion and determination that I submit my application
for the Food & Beverage and Lounge Operations positions with Qatar
Airways. Having closely followed the \"spectacular growth\" of Qatar
Airways and its reputation as a leader in 5-star excellence, I am eager
to contribute my luxury hospitality experience and aviation training to
your premium lounge operations in Doha.

My professional background is defined by a commitment to the highest
standards of service. During my recent internship as a Waitress at the
**Four Seasons Hotel Rabat**, I learned the art of delivering 5-star F&B
service in a world-class environment. I am well-versed in meticulous
mise en place, fine dining etiquette, and the importance of anticipating
guest needs before they are voiced. I take great pride in my ability to
create \"Moments of Magic\" for guests, ensuring that every interaction
is a chance to \"surprise and delight.\"

In addition to my luxury hotel experience, my time as a Customer Service
Agent at the **International Airport of Casablanca** provided me with a
deep understanding of the aviation industry\'s fast-paced nature. I am
comfortable working within diverse teams and managing the high
expectations of premium travelers. Furthermore, my Accredited Diploma
from **INFOHAS** has specialized me in Aviation Hospitality and CRM,
ensuring that my service delivery is always in line with international
airline standards.

I am a trilingual communicator, fluent in English, Arabic, and French,
and I maintain an impeccable level of personal grooming and professional
etiquette. I am fully prepared to relocate to Doha and dedicated to
upholding the brand value of Qatar Airways at every touchpoint of the
customer journey.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the
possibility of joining your extraordinary story and delivering
excellence in your premium lounges.

Sincerely,

**Sahar Elboumtiri**
